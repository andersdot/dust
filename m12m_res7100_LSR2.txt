# m12m_res7100: LSR 2
# coordinates of a local standard of rest (LSR)
# positions and velocities are:
#   relative to the galaxy center
#   aligned with the galaxys principal axes
#   in cartesian units (x, y, z), (v_x, v_y, v_z)
# velocity is median of 247 star particles within 200 pc of position
# star particle nearest to position has array index = 7549480, dist = 0.042 kpc
# position [kpc] velocity [km/s]
